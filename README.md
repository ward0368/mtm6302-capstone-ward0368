I kept this design similar to the original as it is simple and user friendly. I wanted the fonts to be simple and legible while also looking professional, hence the usage of 'Lato' and 'Lucida Bright'. The color choice of orange is because orange tones are usually the first that come to my mind when designing a website and catch your attention with their vibrant look

I recently found out Lucida Bright is a paid font and therefore switched to just using Lato (regular and bold).


Report: Throughout this design, I encountered countless challenges. You may notice that my wireframe doesn't look exactly like my current site, that's because I had to make many changes to my site to be able to create it for real. The API key was also quite a challenge, as I am not very proficient with Javascript and it took a lot of research and dedication to get it to work. Ontop of this, I had to create a favorites section. This was my biggest challenge in my entire coding career. It took hours. Other than that, styling wasn't too bad, I have been styling sites for Web Dev classes and CMS classes for a while and am therefore quite proficient with it. The fact that this capstone REQUIRES JS this early on was a bit of a roadblock, but I worked through it and ultimately completed my assignment. My webpage is fully responsive, and the mobile version was made responsive and more accessible for mobile devices. Overall, I am satisfied with my website, and hope I can keep this knoweldge.

Steps Taken:
- I created my HTML, CSS and JS files
- I started building my HTML (footers, title, headers, etc.)
- I research API keys and how to implement them with JS on W3 schools and asked a couple of my friends
- I found out the solution and executed. I made the code work alongside a favorites feature.
- I styled all of this within CSS using Flexbox and the Lato font.
- I create a media query for mobile devices to make the site more accessible
- I made sure the site was responsive for both desktop and mobile (chaging font sizes, layouts, button sizes, etc.)
- I made my design use colors from my wireframe and attempted to make my site look alike to my wireframe.
- I validated all my code.
- I submitted.
