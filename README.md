I kept this design similar to the original as it is simple and user friendly. I wanted the fonts to be simple and legible while also looking professional, hence the usage of 'Lato' and 'Lucida Bright'. The color choice of orange is because orange tones are usually the first that come to my mind when designing a website and catch your attention with their vibrant look

I recently found out Lucida Bright is a paid font and therefore switched to just using Lato (regular and bold).
